# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Image Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

The image plugin renders an image with a caption in a half-width frame. Double-clicking the image to enlarge it. Double-clicking the caption to edit it like a paragraph.
